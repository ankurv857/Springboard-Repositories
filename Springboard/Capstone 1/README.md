## Objective
Buying a home is the largest finanical transaction most people make in their lifetime.  I'm interested in creating a model that will predict home prices based on some common features of a home.  

## Target Audience  
Realtors and home-buyers woudld be interested in the applications of this model, as it would allow them to predict what the prices would be for the type home they are looking to buy/sell.  The model is limited by it's restricted geography and time.  

## The Data
The data is from the popular data site Kaggle.com.  The data was scraped and made available by user harlfoxem.  It is in csv format, and is pre-cleaned.  The features are discussed in the report. 

## Approach
1) Ensure no pre-processing needs to be done.
2) Explore the data visually.
3) Cluster the homes based on their price, square footage, and grade (rating). 
4) Use feature encoding to create better indicators of price.
5) Use trial and error to hone feature selection, using MAPE as main metric for success.
6) Report findings.
7) Identify challenges and limitations and provide recommendations for the future.
